    <section id="information">
      <p>I currently live in sunny Los Angeles, CA and work as a Fractional Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/%E9%87%9A/" target="_blank">Lechter Ventures</a>.</p>
      <p>Before this, I worked as a Data Scientist turned Analytics Engineer at <a href="subject.com" target="_blank">Subject</a>.</p>
      <p>Even before that, I was a student at UC Berkeley and interned at very different companies like 
        <a href="https://www.verdocapital.com/" target="_blank">Verdo Capital</a>, 
        the <a href="https://controller.lacity.gov/" target="_blank">City of LA</a>, 
        <a href="https://about.nike.com/en" target="_blank">Nike</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.pineparkhealth.com/" target="_blank">Pine Park Health</a>, and 
        <a href="https://www.particlehealth.com/" target="_blank">Particle Health</a>.</p>

      <p>I fell in love with businesses when my family bought our very first small business in 2012. I was 12 years old and spent most of my free time helping my 
      family build our business. I fell in love with the process.</p>

      <p>In college I took my varied interests and learned <a href="https://www.diversatech.org/" target="_blank">design and product management</a>,
        <a href="https://www.berkeleyinvestment.group/" target="_blank">finance</a>, <a href="https://www.berkeleyuea.com/" target="_blank">economics</a>, and data science.</p>

      <p>Now, I'm figuring out what to do next.</p>
